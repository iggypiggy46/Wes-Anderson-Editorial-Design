    <h1>Wes Anderson:
      <br>One Mans Filmography
      </h1>
    <p>"Usually when I'm making a movie, what I have in mind first, for the visuals, is how we can stage the scenes to bring them more to life in the most interesting way, and then how we can make a world for the story that the audience hasn't quite been in before."<br>-Wes Anderson</p>

    <h1>1990's</h1>
    <p>Bottle Rocket (1996): Wes Anderson burst onto the scene with his directorial debut, "Bottle Rocket." Co-written with Owen Wilson, the film showcased the filmmaker's early penchant for quirky characters and deadpan humor.<br><br>Rushmore (1998):The film featured intricate set designs, a penchant for symmetry, and a soundtrack that would become a trademark in his later works.</p>

    <h1>2000's</h1>
    <p>The Royal Tenenbaums (2001): Anderson continued to refine his signature style in "The Royal Tenenbaums," a film that showcased his ability to create a world both fantastical and deeply human.<br><br>The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou (2004):A film that I believe really set Anderson apart from other filmmakers. His ability to combine humor, stakes, and style mesh together to form an unforgetable journey of a man at sea<br><br> Fantastic Mr.Fox (2009): This stop motion adaptation of one of Roald Dahl's classic books is not to be overlooked. It's style and messaging are unlike any other childs movie with it's deep philisophical insight on what it is to be a fox in a hole</p>

    <h1>2010's</h1>
    <p>Moonrise Kingdom (2012): Anderson's nostalgic aesthetic and precise framing were on full display, capturing the essence of childhood adventures with a unique blend of whimsy and poignancy.<br><br>The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014):  My personal favorite from Wes Anderson, this thing is punchy and heart felt from beginning to end. A tale of tragedy, love, and friendship. Every character is rememerable and every scene in unforgetable<br><br>Isle of Dogs (2016): A return to stop-motion. This is a really interesting film that follows a boy who loves his dog.</p>
